# MinStack Router

Basic declarative routing for React.

**It does:**

- Match routes by path patterns
- Match one route exclusively from a set of routes
- Provide `onClick` navigation handlers
- Support path parameters
- Support partial path (prefix with trailing wildcard) matching
- Support redirection
- Support path, hash, or memory-only (SSR/testing) navigation

**It does not:**

- Match routes by search parameters
- Provide lazy loading
- Provide error boundaries
- Provide navigation confirmation/prompting/blocking
- Provide a `<Link>` component
- Support path parameter regular expressions
- Support wildcards anywhere except at the end of a route
